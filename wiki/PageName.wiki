TODO list:
----

Make sure our .cpp files compile. They should be checked in order from simplest/smallest to largest/complexest. The following still need to be checked:
 * Bot.cpp
 * Map.cpp
 * PolarPoint.cpp
 * PixelPoint.cpp
 * PhysicalLine.cpp (may not even be used...)
 * mci.cpp
 * serial.cpp
 * vision.cpp



We need to check our makefiles to make sure they are all doing the right things.

Blob recognition of a given color. Shape is not important, we just need the centroid of the 'blob' of color.

Test the motor controller with a motor controller test file. Just see if the basic mci functions work.

Put functionality into our movement functions that keeps track of our position and angle.
