TODO list:

Make sure our .cpp files compile. They should be checked in order from simplest/smallest to largest/complexest. The following still need to be checked:
Angle.cpp
Bot.cpp
Map.cpp
PolarPoint.cpp
PixelPoint.cpp
PhysicalLine.cpp (may not even be used...)
mci.cpp
serial.cpp
vision.cpp



We need to check our makefiles to make sure they are all doing the right things.
