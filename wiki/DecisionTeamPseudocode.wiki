while(true)  //or some more specific condition
	
	evaluateCharge(charge, lastFillupTime) 		//see if we have collected enough charge to go back to the flag
							//note: after a certain time without filling up, as a failsafe, 
							//go back to the flag no matter how much charge we have

	evaluatePosition(map, ourPosition, feedFromCam) //this calls upon a lot of geographical functionality. it says: 
							//if map position doesn't match vision input, then resolve that problem.
							//this may be done entirely by geog team

	decideNextDestination(ourPosition, chargeHeld)  //execute team will move to this next destination.
